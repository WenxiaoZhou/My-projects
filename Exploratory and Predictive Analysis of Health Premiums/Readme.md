This project is constructing statistical models for predicting insurance premiums basing on customers’ information. 
The main part is the MLR model with model selection to choose the most relevant factors to determine the premium. 
Diagnose and remedies of the model are also included. This part is realized in “project.R” file, “stepwise.r” is also 
need to upload to the memory at the top of the code. 
Also, the random forest method and neural networks algorithm are used to make comparisons with the MLR model on the performance of model predictions. 
The R codes are respectively “pro_neutral.R” and “pro_randomforest.R”.
