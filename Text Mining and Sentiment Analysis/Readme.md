This folder contains case studies and projects about Text Mining and Sentiment Analysis. 
I will also share a small tutorial with a PPT of my learning in basic text mining and sentiment analysis.
This tutorial contains two main case studies: Lyrics analysis and Airbnb Reviews Sentiment Analysis.
If you are interested to have a try, the Lyrics case, please check "The_cure_lyrics.txt" as the original dataset. As for
Airbnb case, check a dataset created in R names as "bos_reviews.rds". If you have other datasets that are similar to these two
cases, I believe my codes are generic or at least can make as a reference or inspire you in some ways.

Please feel free to communicate with me! Thanks!
